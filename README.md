## Usage

For employers, collaborators, and those interested in my work, please view this portfolio with curiosity and kindness. The current state of this portfolio repeats project thumbnails to fill in space. Although those thumbnails are all functioning links, they all deploy to the same deployed project. In the future, they will be updated with additional exciting projects.
